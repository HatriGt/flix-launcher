[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-30

### Important
- Releases are now signed with a proper release key. 1.0.0 was signed with a debug key, so **uninstall 1.0.0 once** before installing 1.0.2. Later updates install over it normally.

### Added
- OK on a film (or a Continue watching episode) opens Nuvio's stream list directly

### Fixed
- Works with the Play Store version of Nuvio (com.nuvio.app), which showed "Install Nuvio"
- Crash when opening a title in Nuvio
- Left/Right at the end of the apps row, top menu or carousel buttons no longer jumps to another row
- Tiles no longer keep the poster shape for a few seconds while moving along a row
- Release builds can no longer be signed with the debug key by accident

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-27

### Added
- Back up and restore all settings, favourites and addon rows (Settings → About)

### Fixed
- Phone remote now needs the code from the TV's QR link, accepts changes only as form posts, and limits connections
- Home key service no longer touches other apps' accessibility services, and stays off when you turn it off
- Trailers no longer stop or swap when moving quickly between titles; trailer ids from addons are validated
- Poster cards no longer pick up another row's details or size; clicked posters spring back
- Background video and photos stop fully when you leave the home screen
- Cached files are saved safely and downloads have size limits
- Nuvio: a rejected sign-in now shows as signed out; tokens are stored encrypted
- Plain-HTTP traffic is limited to Apple's aerial video server; addons must use https

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-27

First public release.

### Added
- Favourites row and an apps grid on the home screen itself
- Film and show rows from Stremio-compatible addons, with Top 10, genre filter and a featured carousel (can be switched off)
- Continue watching from a Nuvio account, with progress on each card and on the selected card
- Trailers behind the selected title, with start delay and sound options
- About 270 aerial video backgrounds in five categories, and photo backgrounds from the Bing archive
- Clock, greeting, date, sunrise/sunset arc, weather and 3-day forecast
- Searchable settings
- Home key handling for Google TV

### Performance
- Icons redrawn once into GPU bitmaps: about 54 MB of memory on a 2 GB TV
- Favourite apps appear before the rest of the app list is drawn
